file upload is prob

did file upload via restlet from python api


todo:
js file upload -> lambda server -> restlet

OR no lambda?

finish it with no filtering for gmkk/gikk (maybe i can get subsidary from the customer itself) CAN!!
fields:
class, department from class
location probably needed
customer
item and its quant and rate at least. maybe check for default rate

steps:
(get customer and get class can be a seperate suitelet which is called by the main suitelet)

suiteql call customers, select customer, get that customers info including subsidary.
suiteql classes, select class, get department from that class.
suiteql locations, select location.
suiteql items, select item, select its quant and rate? (could get rate from the item itself...)
optionally add a file(pdf) and store its binary data.
submit and send data to create estimate suitelet. if file data exists create the file and bind it to the estimate.
